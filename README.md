# Project Proposal: CO2 Flight Challenge Game

## Project Overview
This project is a Python-based educational game where the objective is to successfully complete flight challenges while managing a limited CO2 quota. The user attempts to “fly” different routes without exceeding the defined amount of CO2 emissions. On successful completion of a round, the user receives a new task; after each round, they may choose to continue or leave the game.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Core game logic and user interaction
- **SQL database**: Storing user progress, game state, and CO2 tracking data

## Goals
- Encourage awareness about CO2 emissions through an interactive game scenario
- Track user success and progress using an SQL database
- Provide multiple game rounds with progressive difficulty or different flight scenarios

## Gameplay Loop
1. Player is assigned a flight challenge with a CO2 limit.
2. Player must complete the route using available resources, aiming to stay within the allowed emissions.
3. Upon success, player receives the next challenge.
4. After each round, player can opt to continue or exit.

## Development Plan
- Set up Python codebase and SQL schema for game data
- Implement core gameplay features and logic for flight challenges
- Establish connection between Python and SQL database for saving/loading progress

## Team
- Moreira Da Silva Luara
- Kuznetsova Maria
- Petrova Olena

## Next Steps
- Draft full requirements and database schema
- Design basic user interface for game interaction
- Create initial test scenarios for flight challenges
